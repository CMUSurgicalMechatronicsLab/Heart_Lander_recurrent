# Heart_Lander_recurrent
Overview
This repository contains the implementation files for the Heart Lander project, which is a robotic system designed to assist in epicardial interventions. The development and design are based on methodologies detailed in the paper "Development of a Flexible Parallel Wire Robot for Epicardial Interventions". The system utilizes motors and servos for precise control, and adheres to the heart using a new suction base design, as detailed below.

Setup Instructions
1. Hardware Components
Motors and Servos: The system is driven by a set of motors and servos to control the movement of the robotic arms and suction bases.
New Motor Holder: The design includes a newly developed motor holder, which is located in the design_files directory.
Suction Base: The robot now utilizes a redesigned suction base that provides improved adhesion to the heart. The new suction base design can be found in the design_files folder.
2. Software Components
Arduino Setup: The arduino_files folder contains the necessary Arduino files for setting up and controlling the motors. This includes base functions for motor and servo configuration.
3. Design Files
Motor Holder: CAD files for the new motor holder design.
Suction Base: CAD files for the redesigned suction base. This improved design ensures stable adherence to the heart during operation.
Steps to Use
Follow the Paper: Detailed steps for setting up and operating the Heart Lander system are based on the paper. Ensure you review the design and setup guidelines carefully.
Hardware Assembly: Assemble the motors, servos, and the new motor holder using the designs provided.
Arduino Configuration: Upload the base Arduino code from the arduino_files folder to configure the motors and servos.
Operate the System: Once the hardware and software are configured, you can begin using the Heart Lander system for epicardial interventions as per the methodology outlined in the paper.
